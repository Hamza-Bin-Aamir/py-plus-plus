# py-plus-plus
Started as a joke between me and my classmate Areeb, turned into something genuinely usable for when you just want to get something done quickly in c++ with easier/shorter syntax.
## WARNING + DISCLAIMER
This code is extremely (see: DANGEROUSLY) unsafe. DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE, use this for production code. This is intended for easy and quick prototyping or small-scale simple and predictable applications. Some of the features (such as the implementation of f-strings) can raise serious security issues.
